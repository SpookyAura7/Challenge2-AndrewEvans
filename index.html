                <p>
                    See that handsome, however scruffy, gentlement beaming on the right up there? That would be me. My name is Andrew Evans. I was born June 20th, 1996 in Maplewood, MN. I have always had a passion for anything automotive and worked in that field for many years. I believe that my road of automotive careers has run its course, and it is time to pursue a carrer in the tech field, my other main interest. My passion is to help people and make the average human life just a bit easier. I believe I will be in a better position to do so in web development.
